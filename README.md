# Hash-Table
Hash table implementation in C++

The demo application uses a hash table with a string key and value, with the intended use of name and phone number, though formatting is not enforced.


Command list:
  - search <name> - Search the table for an entry of <name>
  - add <name> <number> - Create a new entry of <name> and <number>, or if an entry of <name> already exists, change its number
  - help - Display this text
  - exit - Exit the program
